			<p>This is a small game with simple rules:</p>
			<p>1. Given two persons, you must guess if they could have met (regardless of
				physical distance). This means their lifespan overlap.</p>
			<p>2. Given a person and a great work (political, artistic, etc.), you must
				guess
				if
				the
				person could have known the work. This means the work appeared before or
				during
				the lifetime of the person.</p>
			<p>Your score is based on the number of consecutive correct guesses, and
				resets to zero when you miss</p>
			<p>The idea came from the mild bewilderment I felt when I realized Thomas
				Jefferson could've met Mozart. Two worlds.</p>
			<p>All the data come from <a href="https://www.wikidata.org">Wikidata</a>,
				bless
				them and their work. Due to the automated collection of works and the way
				wikidata structures data, there might be some wonky choices and unintuitive
				dates.</p>
