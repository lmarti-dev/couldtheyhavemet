			<p>This is a small game with simple rules:</p>
			<p>1. Given two persons, you must guess if they could have met (regardless of
				physical distance). This means their lifespan overlap.</p>
			<p>2. Given a person and a great work (political, artistic, etc.), you must
				guess
				if
				the
				person could have known the work. This means the work came before or during
				the lifetime of the person.</p>
			<p>Your score is based on the number of consecutive correct guesses, and
				resets to zero when you miss</p>
			<p>The idea came from the mild bewilderment I felt when I realized Thomas
				Jefferson could've met Mozart. Two worlds.</p>
